I have trained singular value decomposition and non-negative matrix factorization models on the same dataset using python surprise library in order to compare with my implementation (\citet{Surprise}). The models were optimized for 100 epochs each and 3 fold cross-validated. 
The SVD model was run $\lambda$ of 0.05 for regularization and learning rate of 0.001. The NMF model trained used biases instead of baselines and regularization $\lambda$ of 1.

The result are in \ref{comparison} and show that even without side-information my model achieves a 4.17\% decrease in RMSE compared to SVD model and 5.26\% when compared to NMF model. Adding genres information reduces RMSE and MAE by 0.32\% and 0.97\% respectively when compared to basic NNCF. The final model incorporates genres and average ratings for movie and user. It improves on NNCF by 0.62\% RMSE and 1.66\% MAE.
