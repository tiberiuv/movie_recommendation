\title{Movie Recommendation System}

\author{Tiberiu Simion Voicu}

\address{Post graduate thesis project, ECS751P}

\begin{abstract}
    Recommender systems aim to provide users with personalized recommendations of items. This helps a lot in filtering irrelevant items from the big collection. It is usually achieved through collaborative filtering. 
    Neural networks have proven to be highly effective in natural language processing, computer vision and speech recognition. Despite this, they haven't seen as much use in solving recommendation problems. This is partly because state of the art matrix factorization methods are already very effective for this problem. The system described in this paper will make use of multilayer perceptron networks to solve the recommendation problem using collaborative filtering. The design and implementation details of the recommendation engine will be discussed and the results compared with traditional matrix factorization methods. Furthermore, it will also go into detail about the choices that went into creating a scalable overall system and accompanying web application.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper I have covered the best practices in deep learning and recommender systems. These include regularization, activation functions and principles of fast and stable multi-gpu training in keras. Furthermore I have implemented a demonstration web application that allows rating movies and serving recommendations. It is designed to be scalable and easy to extend in the future. I have also compared the DNN performance with traditional matrix factorization algorithms. The results show that deep learning can be used for solving the recommendation problem and it achieves better evaluation performance than the MF methods.
\subsection{Future Work}
Possible improvements to the system include the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporate more content information into the system such as movie title, summary, and cast. This could be achieved using pre-trained word embeddings such as word2Vec or glove (\citet{glove}).
    \item Add recurrent layers such as GRU or LSTM.
    \item Train a convolutional network on movie posters. Then incorporate said network into the CF model.
    \item Use a deeper and wider architecture for network.
\end{itemize}
